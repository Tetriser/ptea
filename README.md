# Perry the Explorer Alien (salvaged version)
For hosting a salvaged version of Perry the Explorer Alien, one of my earliest games.

* Sounds have been redone
* Featuring music from [Eric Matyas](https://soundimage.org/)

## Music used
- Gulf Breeze - Title screen
- Dancing on Clouds - Gameplay
- Into Battle v1 - Boss battle

# INFORMATION
* The "Website" option points to my old Weebly website, which is dead now.
* For some reason, the title screen music won't play the first time you enter the title screen after a load.
